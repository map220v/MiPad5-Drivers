  <summary>Important information</summary>
  <p>
- ⚠️ This version of the drivers needs to be paired with UEFI version greater than or equal to 2403.41.

- ⚠️ For users who are updating from an earlier release than version 2301.93, please reinstall.

- ⚠️ If you need dual boot, you will have to make your own image. Please follow this guidance: https://github.com/WOA-Project/SurfaceDuo-Guides/blob/main/DualBoot.md

- ⚠️ You need to backup your original boot image for OTAs to work with Android. When you get an OTA, you will want to revert your boot image for the update to work, or you'll have to use an official OTA recovery package.

### Release notes

#### Surface Duo (1st Gen)

What's new?

- Introducing Vulkan and OpenCL support (preliminary)
  This uses the actual GPU and no compat pack, if you have the compatibility pack installed, it can conflict, so please remove it before first use.
  This remains a bit experimental if there's issues in loading Vulkan or OpenCL please let us know!

- Stability Fixes (again)

- Updated most drivers to the latest versions from Qualcomm (again) and Surface

- We fixed issues that would make devices be unstable or stop working after taking a driver update using driver updater. You should never get update issues from now on. (again)

- We fixed a big issue that made Surface Duo 2 not work as expected for quite a while, while things aren't still back to where they should be, they're definitely better. We're working on it

- We fixed an issue that resulted in pen input being swapped incorrectly across displays on Surface Duo (1st Gen)

- Please download ```SurfaceDuo-Drivers-v2403.41-Desktop-Epsilon.zip``` if you want drivers for Surface Duo 1
- Please download ```SurfaceDuo-Drivers-v2403.41-Desktop-Zeta.zip``` if you want drivers for Surface Duo 2

- We are aware auto pairing of the pen will not work anymore on Windows 10, a fix is due in the next update.

<details>
  <summary>Known issues</summary>
  <p>
- Installing Gallium Semester Insider builds may lead to a black screen on second boot of the OS, simply press the power button to continue.

- Booting Windows 10 18362/18363 will lead to "static screen" effects on the right display, much like driver releases from last year did on any version of Windows. A fix is being worked on for the next release.

- The TPM driver is not working for Windows 10 18362/18363. A fix is being worked on for the next release.

- The Posture driver is not working for Windows 10 18362/18363. A fix is being worked on for the next release.

- Enhanced auto rotation is not working for Windows 10 18362/18363. A fix is being worked on for the next release.

- Brightness control is glitchy on both displays.

- On device speakers are not functional.

- Dongles are not detected correctly when plugged into the USB Type-C port.

- Updating drivers may lead to weird configurations if done on old driver releases.

- MAC addresses do not reflect the real addresses asigned to the device.

- BitLocker drive encryption is not available.

- USB dongles that are not externally powered may not currently work.

- USB-C Billboard devices will not currently work.

- External Display Stream support will not currently work.

- Additional information provided by the posture sensor is currently not available for public consumption. This includes peek events.

- Digitizers will not react to the device being folded over.

- Displays will not react to the device being folded over most of the time.

- Physical device data is incorrect.

- Digitizers aren't calibrated correctly.

- Flipping the device is not smooth.

- Users upgrading from releases older than the January ones may want to clean install again.

- Booting Windows 10 18362/18363 with Secure Boot enabled is not currently supported and will result in a broken installation.

- In some cases, booting the UEFI image may lead to "static screen" effects on the left display. Please do not force reboot the device as it may interrupt the installation process, if ongoing, and instead please wait a few minutes.

- Windows Recovery environment lacks drivers unless Windows has performed a Feature Update at least once.

- sRGB is not available currently, and displays will not react to ICC profiles being applied.

#### Surface Duo 2

What's new?

- Surface Duo 2 is still a Proof of Concept (PoC), don't expect much.

  <summary>Accessing Foldable Sensors from your applications</summary>
  <p>
In order to currently access the sensor data given by the foldable sensors, you need to use the following apis:


- Windows.Devices.Sensors.HingeAngleSensor*
- Windows.Internal.Devices.Sensors.FlipSensor* (2)
- Windows.Internal.System.TwoPanelHingePostureDevice* (2)


(2): These apis require the use of an externally sourced winmd available from https://github.com/ADeltaX/InternalWinMD/blob/master/%23winmd/Windows.Internal.Devices.Sensors.winmd


In the future, further apis will be functional (specifically under the Windows.System.Preview namespace). Consider this an early "thing".


The following API may be used to determine if your app is used on a dual screen device: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/uwp/api/windows.ui.windowmanagement.windowingenvironment.getdisplayregions?view=winrt-22621

The following API may be used to determine on which display region your app is currently being shown: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/uwp/api/windows.ui.windowmanagement.appwindow.getdisplayregions?view=winrt-22621

The following API may be used to move your application to the other display: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/uwp/api/windows.ui.windowmanagement.appwindow.requestmoverelativetodisplayregion?view=winrt-22621

THe following API may be used to move your application to a specific display: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/uwp/api/windows.ui.windowmanagement.appwindow.requestmovetodisplayregion?view=winrt-22621

The following API may be used for spanning purposes: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/uwp/api/windows.ui.windowmanagement.appwindow.requestsize?view=winrt-22621

The Windowing Environment for Windows Desktop editions (outside of tablet mode) is Overlapped. Tiled is used for Tablet Mode and Windows Core OS's ModernPC.
